  <h1>Hello.</h1>
  <p id="i-am">
    My name is David Guimaraes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a Computer Engineer from Brazil. If you want to know more about me and my work, please click

  <p>
    I am starting to organize a software/development portfolio on
    <a href="https://github.com/DavidGuimaraes" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
    Even though I just started organizing things there, I have been constantly uploading my repos. You might want
    to take a look. :)
